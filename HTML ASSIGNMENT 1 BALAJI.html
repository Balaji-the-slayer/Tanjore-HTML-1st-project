                <p>This place was previously called Siyali. Indra once fled to this place in fear of the asura called Surapadma and did tapas here
                 There are no references to Thanjavur in the Sangam period (third century BCE to fourth century CE) Tamil records, though some scholars believe that the city has existed since that time. Kovil Venni, situated 15 miles (24 km) to the east of the city, was the site of the Battle of Venni between the Chola king Karikala and a confederacy of the Cheras and the Pandyas. The Cholas seemed to have faced an invasion of the Kalabhras in the third century CE after which the kingdom faded into obscurity. The region around present day Thanjavur was conquered by the Mutharayars during the sixth century, who ruled it up to 849.
                The Cholas came to prominence once more through the rise of the Medieval Chola monarch Vijayalaya (841–878 CE) in about 850 CE. Vijayalaya conquered Thanjavur from the Mutharayar king Elango Mutharayar and built a temple dedicated to the Hindu goddess Nisumbhasudani. His son Aditya I (871–901) consolidated their hold over the city. The Rashtrakuta king Krishna II (878–914), a contemporary of the Chola king Parantaka I (907–950), claims to have conquered Thanjavur, but there are no records to support the claim. Gradually, Thanjavur became the most important city in the Chola Empire and remained its capital till the emergence of Gangaikonda Cholapuram in about 1025. During the first decade of the eleventh century, the Chola king Raja Raja Chola I (985–1014) constructed the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur. The temple is considered to be one of the best specimens of Tamil architecture
                Thanjavur was successfully conquered in 1674 by Ekoji I (1675–84), the Maratha feudatory of the sultan of Bijapur and half-brother of Shivaji (1627/30-80) of the Bhonsle dynasty. Ekoji founded the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom which ruled Thanjavur till 1855. The Marathas exercised their sovereignty over Thanjavur throughout the last quarter of the 17th and the whole of the 18th century. The Maratha rulers patronized Carnatic music. In 1787, Amar Singh, the regent of Thanjavur, deposed the minor Raja, his nephew Serfoji II (1787–93) and captured the throne. Serfoji II was restored in 1799 with the assistance of the British, who induced him to relinquish the administration of the kingdom and left him in charge of Thanjavur fort and surrounding areas. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the Doctrine of Lapse when Shivaji II (1832–55), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died without a legitimate male heir. The British referred to the city as Tanjore in their records. Five years after its annexation, the British replaced Negapatam (modern-day Nagapattinam) with Thanjavur as the seat of the district administration. Under the British, Thanjavur emerged as an important regional centre. The 1871 India census recorded a population of 52,171, making Thanjavur the third largest city in the Madras Presidency. After India's independence, Thanjavur continued as the district headquarters.

                 <p >Tanjore Paintings: One of the most famous crafts from Tanjavur, these paintings are known for their intricate detailing, vibrant colors, and use of gold foil. They often depict Hindu deities, mythological themes, and religious icons. The technique involves layering a base of plaster of Paris on a wooden frame, followed by meticulous detailing with natural colors and embellishments.</p>

                        <td><p>Thanjavur painting is a classical South Indian painting style, originating in the town of Thanjavur (anglicized as Tanjore) in Tamil Nadu. The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art—chiefly, classical dance and music—as well as literature, both in Telugu and Tamil and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples. However, it can safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676–1855). It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2007–08.
                            Thanjavur paintings are characterised by rich and vivid colours, simple iconic composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or very rarely precious and semi-precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagara, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, Sthala-puranas and other religious texts were visualised, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a mantapa or prabhavali) surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects. There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings.

                            Thanjavur paintings are panel paintings done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as palagai padam (palagai = "wooden plank"; padam = "picture") in local parlance. In modern times, these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in South India.</p></td>

                        <td><p>The Tanjavur style of Bharatanatyam, originating from Tanjavur in Tamil Nadu, is a revered and classical dance form that holds a significant place in Indian cultural heritage. This style is distinguished by its elaborate and expressive performance techniques, which have been refined over centuries. It emphasizes intricate hand gestures (mudras), expressive facial expressions (abhinaya), and precise footwork, all of which work together to narrate mythological stories and convey deep emotions.

                            In the Tanjavur style, the dance repertoire is traditionally divided into specific segments: the Alarippu, which serves as a rhythmic warm-up; the Varnam, a complex and dramatic piece showcasing the dancer’s skill and emotional range; and the Tillana, a lively and rhythmic conclusion. Each component is performed with a focus on maintaining classical aesthetics and intricate detailing.
                            
                            The Tanjavur style is also known for its vibrant costumes, typically featuring richly embroidered silk sarees, and elaborate jewelry, enhancing the visual appeal of the performance. The dance form’s historical roots trace back to the royal patronage of the Chola and Nayak dynasties, which played a crucial role in its development and preservation. Today, it continues to be a celebrated form of classical dance, both in India and internationally, reflecting its enduring artistic and cultural significance.</p></td>

                    Inside, the sanctum houses a massive Shiva Lingam, 3.6 meters (12 feet) tall, symbolizing Shiva. The temple’s mandapa (pillared hall) is supported by intricately carved pillars adorned with detailed sculptures of Hindu deities and mythological scenes, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship.
                    
                    Constructed entirely from granite, the temple demonstrates advanced engineering techniques and precision in stone cutting. An architectural marvel of the Brihadisvara Temple is the optical illusion of the Vimana’s height, designed to appear perfectly aligned from all angles. Additionally, some believe the temple's design incorporates astronomical and mathematical principles, reflecting the advanced knowledge of the Chola architects.
                    
                    The Brihadisvara Temple remains a symbol of Chola architectural brilliance and cultural heritage.</p>
